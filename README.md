### ROCK-PAPER-SCISSORS

    -   Basic RPS game with player vs PC.
    -   pc chooses in randomly using random module.
            - random.randrange
            - the integer generated will be used as an index of the rps tuple.
    -   I get player's choice using input which takes a string of either rock, paper, or scissors.
    -   whoever scores 5 first wins the game.
    -   player will be asked if they want to play again, if not then the game over.
